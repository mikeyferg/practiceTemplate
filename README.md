practiceTemplate
================

This is the base template that I use when coding.

Here is a list of resources that I refer to for backup.

1.  Comprehensive list of JS properties and methods.  (note.  Is missing some function array methods).

2. RegEx Tester

3.  List of useful array methods missing from 1.
  .filter
  .forEach
  .find
  .map
  .reduce
